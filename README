What:
This is an instrument file for adding links to Twitter and URL links to strings in your Orchestra MVC Apps.
This adds a method for adding auto linkifying to any Twitter username or hash tags, as well can auto link urls and email addresses.

Installation:
First you must have already installed the sys_orchestra (https://github.com/christopherhein/system-orchestra-mvc)
If that is installed use:

  $ instrument pull linkify-addon
  
This with build the instrument locally in /usr/local/orchestra/instruments/ once that is complete you can use:

  $ instrument install linkify-addon
  
from the root directory of any Orchestra App and it will install all the necessary files, plus walk you through any additional steps.

Enjoy!
